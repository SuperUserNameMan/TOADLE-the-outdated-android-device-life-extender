# TOADLE : The Outdated Android Device Life Extender

This is a collection of ideas to extend the life of your outdated Android devices that are rotting in a drawer awaiting a new purpose or an ultimate jump into the void of your bin.

## Basics :

### try to upgrade the firwmare :
Browsing the web, you still might be able to find some old firmware updates you did not bother to install years ago. If you're lucky, you'll manage to upgrade your Android to a newer version. If you're unlunky, you'll manage to brick your device or to install a trojan.

### Get rid of the remaining Google apps :
Google apps consumme a lot of memory and CPU that make your old Android device slower and harder to give new purpose. You can get rid of all of them if you don't need them. Goto the Application list, some can be fully uninstalled, others will allow you to uninstall the updates only ... still, several megabytes removed is good for your old outdated device. And to prevent them from running in the background, disable them ! Your old outdated device will be happier.

### Install an alternative to Google Play :

**[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)** is a good alternative to Google Play as it contains lot of opensource free applications that you can try. Most of them are ugly, useless, broken, no more compatible, but you can find some usefull one that will give a purpose to your outdated device. If the most recent version of an app does not work, F-droid let you pick older version !

### Install an alternative to Google Chrome and to the default webrowser :
If you removed most Google apps, your Google Chrome might be gone too, and on most outdated devices, the default webbrowser is generally so outdated that you won't be able to access any website because of outdated SSL certificates.

**[Firefox](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/releases)** is a good alternative to keep browsing the internet, and to install web-apps.
As of now, Mozilla does not officially provide a direct download link for the Firefox apk. They want you to install it from Google Play. Still, using the link above, you'll have access to their archive of all releases. Most recent version might not work on you outdated device, but using the famous dychotomia method, you'll be able to find the most recent old version compatible with your outdated device.
For reference, on my Android 4.2.1 tabled, it's Firefox 68.8.

## Ideas of new purposes :

### a GIANT clock :

**[Giant Stopwatch](https://f-droid.org/fr/packages/omegacentauri.mobi.simplestopwatch/)** is the best GIANT clock I found and use. Plug your device on the charger, build and glue a nice and beeeeaaaauuutiful DIY decorative framework around it, and you'll have the most *`insert an adjective describing your DIY skills and your aesthetics tastes`* electronic clock ever.

### an ebook and comics book reader :

**[MuPDF viewer](https://f-droid.org/fr/packages/com.artifex.mupdf.viewer.app/)** is a wonderfully simple PDF reader that will let you turn you old outdated tablet into a portable library if your device does not already have a PDF viewer preinstalled. (it says android 5.0 is minimum requirement, but i managed to find an older version i don't rememebr how and where). If you're into electronics or gardening, your old outdated tablet might become a perfect database of datasheets or plants files.

### A todo list manager :

**[Manania](https://f-droid.org/fr/packages/com.zapta.apps.maniana/)** is my favorite simplest and most practical TODO list manager for everyday use. Add tasks to your list. If you don't want to accomplish it today, just click on the right arrow to send it to tommorrow ! And when tomorrow becomes today, it's back into your today's list where you can send it back to tomorrow if you still don't want to accomplish it today.
